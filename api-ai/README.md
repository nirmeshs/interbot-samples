Interbot Connector for API.AI bots.

In order to use this connector, you need to first have a working bot on API.AI. Next, you need to sign up on https://www.interbot.cc/.

Next, please set the API.AI token, the Interbot API key and the Interbot bot name (some unique string) in app.js. Once this is done, please build the project and deploy it.

Now, you need to create a bot in interbot with the chosen unique name and the URL corresponding to app.js (by default http://<ip-address>:5000). Once this is successfully done, you can test the bot.
